# Bing Wallpaper for Mac and Ubuntu

## Information

A script which downloads the latest picture of the day from Bing.com and saves
it to a directory.

The script was tested on:

- Mac OS X 10.8 - 10.12
- Ubuntu 12.04 - 16.04
- Fedora 28

## How to use?

* Just run the **bing-wallpaper.sh** script from the terminal. The script will
  download today's bing image.
* To see available options run the script with the `--help` flag:

```
$ ./bing-wallpaper.sh --help
Usage:
  bing-wallpaper.sh [options]
  bing-wallpaper.sh -h | --help
  bing-wallpaper.sh --version

Options:
  -f --force                     Force download of picture. This will overwrite
                                 the picture if the filename already exists.
  -s --ssl                       Communicate with bing.com over SSL.
  -b --boost <n>                 Use boost mode. Try to fetch latest <n> pictures.
  -q --quiet                     Do not display log messages.
  -n --filename <file name>      The name of the downloaded picture. Defaults to
                                 the upstream name.
  -p --picturedir <picture dir>  The full path to the picture download dir.
                                 Will be created if it does not exist.
                                 [default: $HOME/Pictures/bing-wallpapers/]
  -r --resolution <resolution>   The resolution of the image to retrieve.
                                 Supported resolutions: 1920x1200 1920x1080 800x480 400x240
  -w --set-wallpaper             Set downloaded picture as wallpaper.
  -h --help                      Show this screen.
  --version                      Show version.
```

## Configuration on Mac

* Open Mac's `System Preferences` -> `Desktop & Screensaver`, add the wallpaper
  directory, and configure to taste.

* To have the script run everyday automatically you will need to setup
  launchd. I have provided a sample plist file, found in the Tools directory,
  which can be copied to **$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents** and loaded with the
  command `launchctl load
  $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ideasftw.bing-wallpaper.plist`. Modify the
  plist as needed to point to **bing-wallpaper.sh**.

## Configuration on Linux

**NOTE** These methods are only supported on Gnome.

### systemd

The systemd unit files provided will download the latest image from Bing every
day and configure this as your wallpaper.

1. Clone the repo:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/thejandroman/bing-wallpaper
   ```

2. Copy the ``bing-wallpaper.sh`` to ``~/bin``:

   ```
   $ mkdir -p ~/bin
   $ cp bing-wallpaper/bing-wallpaper.sh ~/bin
   ```

3. Update the systemd unit files to reference your home directory:

   ```
   sed -e 's@\${home}@'"$HOME"'@' Tools/systemd/bing-wallpaper-change.service -i
   ```

   (tl;dr: This uses `sed` to substitute the `${home}` token with your actual
   home directory)

3. Copy the (modified) systemd unit files to ``~/.config/systemd/user``:

   ```
   $ mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
   $ cp bing-wallpaper/systemd/* ~/.config/systemd/user
   ```

4. Enable the systemd unit files:

   ```
   $ systemctl --user enable bing-wallpaper-change.timer
   $ systemctl --user start bing-wallpaper-change.timer
   ```

5. Verify that the timer is loaded

   ```
   $ systemctl --user list-timers
   ```

6. Profit $$$

All images will be downloaded to `~/Pictures/Wallpaper`. You may wish to
change your wallpaper more than once per day, in which case you should look at
the [Desk Changer
extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1131/desk-changer/)
